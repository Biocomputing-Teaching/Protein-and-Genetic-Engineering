    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein folding and design are two faces of the same coin. The former defines the problem of finding the path to the native structure given a fixed sequence. The latter is the problem of finding the sequence that can adopt a specific fold. Although they have this semantical relationship, computationally, they are tackled very differently. However, they still maintain a very similar recipe: An optimization algorithm that evaluates the perturbation done to a given protein structure with a score function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this practice session, we will write two algorithms to generate trajectories for the protein folding problem and a protein design method that optimizes a given structure in the protein sequence space. \n",
