For details in the installtion process, please see the course repository (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Protein-and-Genetic-Engineering))

### Get the files

To start the session, you'll need the files inside the P1 folder in this repository. To do that is better to have the full repository cloned in your computer:

On your terminal, navigate to a location where you want to download the course repository. Go the desired location where you want to store the repository and execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Protein-and-Genetic-Engineering.git
```

This command will create a folder named "Protein-and-Genetic-Engineering" containing the full repository at its latest version.

Navigate to the Practical Session 1 directory:

```
cd Protein-and-Genetic-Engineering/P1
```

And open the Jupyter notebook inside this folder:

```
jupyter-notebook P1-WorkingWithPoses.ipynb
```
